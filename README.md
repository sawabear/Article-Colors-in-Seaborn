# Article-Colors-in-Seaborn


I wrote this article for the company I currently work for - Lamoda Tech.
The text (in Russian) was published on https://habr.com/.

In this article I will talk about my vision of working with color when visualizing graphs. I’ll show you everything with examples—I’m sure you’ll like them.
I will show not only pictures of what happened then, but also give examples of code, and also explain the logic of decision-making: how to use this or that palette in a specific task. And most importantly, I will give step-by-step advice on how to make the schedule more logical and understandable for customers.
